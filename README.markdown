# Userbank

This is an implementation of the Banking Application assignment from HW1, along with the extra credit portions of the assignment as necessary for the Final homework assignment.

The [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) tutorial by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/) was used extensively as a reference.
